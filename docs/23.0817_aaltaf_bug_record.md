## fix old bug in aaltaf

### statement of the BUG:

the only uc before filtered by selected_assumptions is the frame_flag for conflict sequence c[0]     
so, after filtered the uc is empty, which causes the assert ERROR in `get_selected_uc()` func

> It should be a CNF component of input formula when correct.

### the run before ERROR happens

- first loop in try_satisfy(frame_level=0)
    - the result of try_satisfy_at is SAT
    - the result of sat_once is UNSAT
    - so, then add a UC
- second loop in try_satisfy(frame_level=0)
    - the result of try_satisfy_at is UNSAT
- so, then while loop is terminated
    - when add a UC the assert ERROR happen

### how to reproduce the BUG

`dcounter/counters_3` case, with remove the BlockState func OR invoke CARChecker to do LTLf SAT directly

### found reason

`solver.cpp` Line217: `set_max_used_id(tmp->id());` omitted
